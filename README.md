# Proves Core Reference Project

This is a reference software implementation for the [Proves Kit](https://docs.proveskit.space/en/latest/).

## System Requirements
- F Prime System Requirements listed [here](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/getting-started/installing-fprime/#system-requirements)
- Zephyr dependencies listed [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies) (NOTE: Only complete the install dependencies step, as we run through the rest of the steps in this readme.)

## Installation

First, clone the Proves Core Reference repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Open-Source-Space-Foundation/proves-core-reference
```

Next, navigate to the `proves-core-reference` directory and run `make` to set up the project.

```shell
cd proves-core-reference
make
```

## Running the code

Run generate from the `proves-core-reference` directory. This generates the build cache for FPrime. You only need to do generate if something in the core FPrime package has changed
```shell
make generate
```

Then, and every time you change code, run

```shell
make build
```

### Find the path to your board

Next, plug in your board! If you have previously installed a firmware on your board you may not see it show up as a drive. In that case you'll want to put the board into boot loader mode. Then you'll be able to find the location of the board on your computer. It should be called something like RP2350 but you want to find the path to it

For Mac:
```shell
ls -lah /Volumes
```

For Windows:
Check the letter said to be the mount (ex /d/) and then the name of the removable drive (ex /d/RP2350)

For Linux:
```shell
findmnt
```

Now you want to install the firmware to the board.
```shell
make install BOARD_DIR=[path-to-your-board]
```

or
```
cp build-fprime-automatic-zephyr/zephyr/zephyr.uf2 [path-to-your-board]
```
to copy the uf2 if the make install isn't working


Finally, run the fprime-gds.
```shell
make gds
```
